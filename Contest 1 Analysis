...................Contest Analysis.......................


......Problems Encountered
1) I allowed the time overwhelm me, causing me to lose concentration at some point
2) I spent to much trying to solve one problem                                                       

......Areas to improve ........
1) I need to increase my speed of solving problems
2) I have to avoid spending to much time on one problem
3) Take time in breaking down problems into smaller chunks
4) I need to practice more problems
